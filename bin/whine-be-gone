# Fixes coil whine noise on Dell XPS 13-9333 running archlinux.
#
# Uses logic here https://xps13-9333.appspot.com/#electrical_noises to check
# if keyboard backlight and audio codec power save are in a state which would
# cause noise and if so, toggles the audio codec power saving setting.
#
# It uses inotify to check for the audio powersaving, but this doesn't work for
# the keyboard backlight, so that needs to be run some other way. Unfortunately I
# don't see an easy way to do this automatically other than poll the KEY_BR
# file, so for now I've just mapped a key combination in i3 to run this and
# have to remember to do that whenever I change the keyboard brightness.
# Ideally I would map the keyboard brightness fn combination to run this, but
# because that's special it's not sent to the OS (I think).
#
# If an argument is passed, this only runs once.
